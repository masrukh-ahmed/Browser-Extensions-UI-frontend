# Frontend Mentor - Browser extensions manager UI

![Design preview for the Browser extensions manager UI coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I picked up this challenge from a website named Front End Mentor. Before this i never actually built any good looking website, and even if i did it had no functionality
but since the challenge had clear challenges to solve i went with this challenge and i am really proud of how it turned out. Also this is my first webpage with properly applied responsiveness for different devices and yeah it's not that polished but I am still proud of being able to make this.
I had a really hard time putting together the logic for the Active, Inactive and All filter buttons for the extension. Took me around hald a day to figure that out.
But the end result looks really good and I am in love with the dark mode and light mode functionality.
Learnt how to use local fonts using the @font-face property of CSS and also how to put gradients on the background.
